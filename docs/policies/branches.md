# Branches creation


* To create a branch, the following model must be applied:
```
TagIfExists-BranchName
```

* Branch with no TAG:
```
BranchName
```

* All spaces in **TAG** must be filled with **"_"**:
```
Issue_Number-BranchName
```

* Branch name must not have spaces:
```
Issue_Number-BranchName
```

### Practical Example:
```
Issue_64-FixPhysicsLateUpdate
```
